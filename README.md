# Emotion-and-Object-Detection-with-YOLO
This project aims to develop Emotions and Object Detection Model using YOLO (You Only Look Once) for facial expression and behavioral analysis. The system will detect emotions such as happiness, sadness,neutral and anger, while also identifying objects in the background. By analyzing facial expressions, body posture, and micro-expressions, the model provides a versatile solution for applications in mental health monitoring, security, and customer experience.
